# productgrowth
This is a product growth model using variable selection, time series analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and long-short term memory (LSTM) model to predict product volume growth.

Main steps are as follows:
1) a data pipeline to ingest data and perform ETL
2) time series test to test the staionality
3) a variable selection process and a stepwise regression
4) a linear regressor 
5) a PCA process
5) fitting into an LSTM model
